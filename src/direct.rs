/// An `IdMap` that stores its entries without any indirection,
/// but takes much more space when entries are missing.
///
/// Although this map has slightly less space overhead when most of the entries are present,
/// it has much more space overhead when many entries are missing.
/// Additionally, it's unable to preserve insertion order and the entries are always in declaration order.
/// Iteration is based on the ids of the `IntegerId` keys,
/// and is slower than an `OrderedIdMap` since missing entries have to be manually skipped.
